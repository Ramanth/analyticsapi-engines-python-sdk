Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**cancel_calculation_by_id**](CalculationsApi.md#cancel_calculation_by_id) | **DELETE** /analytics/engines/v2/calculations/{id} | Cancel calculation by id
[**get_calculation_status_by_id**](CalculationsApi.md#get_calculation_status_by_id) | **GET** /analytics/engines/v2/calculations/{id} | Get calculation status by id

# **cancel_calculation_by_id**
> cancel_calculation_by_id(id)

Cancel calculation by id

This is the endpoint to cancel a previously submitted calculation request.  Instead of doing a GET on the getCalculationById URL, cancel the calculation by doing a DELETE.  All individual calculation units within the calculation will be canceled if they have not already finished.

### Example

* Basic Authentication (Basic):
```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import fds.analyticsapi.engines
from fds.analyticsapi.engines.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint
configuration = fds.analyticsapi.engines.Configuration()
# Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic
configuration.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
configuration.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'

# Defining host is optional and default to https://api.factset.com
configuration.host = "https://api.factset.com"
# Create an instance of the API class
api_instance = fds.analyticsapi.engines.CalculationsApi(fds.analyticsapi.engines.ApiClient(configuration))
id = 'id_example' # str | From url, provided from the location header in the Run Multiple Calculations endpoint.

try:
    # Cancel calculation by id
    api_instance.cancel_calculation_by_id(id)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling CalculationsApi->cancel_calculation_by_id: %s\n" % e)
```

### Parameters

# **run_calculation**
> run_calculation(calculation=calculation)

Run calculation

This endpoint creates a new calculation and runs the set of calculation units specified in the POST body.  This must be used first before get status or cancelling endpoints with a calculation id.   A successful response will contain the URL to check the status of the calculation request.    Remarks:  â¢ Maximum 25 points allowed per calculation and maximum 500 points allowed across all simultaneous calculations. (Refer API documentation for more information)                â¢ Any settings in POST body will act as a one-time override over the settings saved in the PA/SPAR/Vault template.
